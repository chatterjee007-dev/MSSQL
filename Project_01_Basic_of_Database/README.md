# SQL Mastery Project: Top 5 Customers with Highest Order Amounts

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on mastering SQL database fundamentals through the creation and manipulation of a `customer_table`. The objective is to write SQL queries to identify the top 5 customers with the highest total order amounts. The goal is to showcase proficiency in SQL query writing, table creation, and data manipulation, making it a compelling demonstration for potential employers.

## Key Features  
- Creating and managing a structured SQL table.
- Inserting and updating data entries.
- Retrieving and aggregating data using SQL queries.
- Identifying top-performing customers based on total order amounts.

## Libraries Used  
- **MSSQL**: The core SQL database management system used for creating and querying the database.

## Code Explanation  
The project includes multiple steps to modularize the implementation:
1. **Creating the `customer_table`**: This step involves defining a table with columns for customer ID, name, region, and order amount. Each column is assigned an appropriate data type to ensure data integrity and precision.
2. **Inserting Data**: In this step, multiple rows of data are inserted into the `customer_table`, representing various customers and their order amounts. This step demonstrates how to populate a table with initial data entries.
3. **Querying Top 5 Customers**: The main focus here is to write a query that retrieves the top 5 customers based on their total order amounts. This involves using aggregation functions like SUM, and clauses like GROUP BY and ORDER BY, to summarize and sort the data.
4. **Updating Data and Re-Querying**: After the initial query, an additional data entry is inserted to update one of the customer's order amounts. The query is then re-run to reflect the updated data and demonstrate how changes in data affect query results.

## Code Structure  
The code is structured to ensure clarity, reusability, and maintainability:
1. **Creating the `customer_table`**
2. **Inserting data into the table**
3. **Querying the top 5 customers by total order amount**
4. **Updating the table and re-querying to reflect changes**

## Prerequisites  
- MSSQL installed on your machine.

## Explanation  
This project demonstrates how to effectively create and manipulate an SQL database table. By writing and executing precise SQL queries, we can derive meaningful insights, such as identifying the top customers based on their total order amounts. This showcases essential SQL skills that are valuable in any data-driven role.

## Insights  
- **Table Creation**: Showcased the ability to define structured tables with appropriate data types.
- **Data Manipulation**: Demonstrated proficiency in inserting, updating, and querying data.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Highlighted the use of aggregate functions and grouping to summarize data.
- **Query Optimization**: Illustrated the importance of ordering and limiting results for efficient data retrieval.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Querying**:
   - Implement more complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and window functions.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Add constraints and indexes to enhance data integrity and query performance.

3. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy and improve data organization.

4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
   - Create stored procedures and functions to encapsulate complex business logic.

5. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Optimize queries and database schema for better performance.
