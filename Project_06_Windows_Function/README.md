# Identifying Employees with Above-Average Salaries Using Window Functions

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on SQL data retrieval and analysis to identify employees who have salaries higher than the average salary of their respective departments. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL table creation, data manipulation, and the use of common table expressions (CTEs) for advanced data analysis.

## Key Features  
- **Table Creation**: Define and create an `employee` table with relevant columns.
- **Data Insertion**: Insert multiple rows of data into the table, representing various employees and their salaries.
- **Data Retrieval**: Write and execute queries to identify employees with salaries above the average for their department.
- **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Use CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance readability.

## Libraries Used  
- **MSSQL**: The core SQL database management system used for creating and querying the database.

## Code Explanation  
The project includes multiple steps to modularize the implementation:
1. **Creating the `employee` table**: This step involves defining a table with columns for employee ID, name, department, and salary. Each column is assigned an appropriate data type to ensure data integrity.
2. **Inserting Data**: In this step, multiple rows of data are inserted into the `employee` table, representing various employees, their departments, and salaries.
3. **Using a Common Table Expression (CTE)**: This step involves creating a CTE to calculate the average salary for each department. The CTE simplifies the process of comparing individual salaries to the department average.
4. **Querying Employees with Above-Average Salaries**: The main focus here is to write a query that uses the CTE to identify employees whose salaries are higher than the average salary of their respective departments.

## Code Structure  
The code is structured to ensure clarity, reusability, and maintainability:
1. **Creating the `employee` table**
2. **Inserting data into the table**
3. **Creating the CTE to calculate average department salaries**
4. **Querying employees with above-average salaries**

## Prerequisites  
- MSSQL installed on your machine.

## Explanation  
This project demonstrates how to effectively create and manipulate an SQL database table. By writing and executing precise SQL queries, we can derive meaningful insights, such as identifying employees who earn more than the average salary of their department. This showcases essential SQL skills that are valuable in any data-driven role.

## Insights  
- **Table Creation**: Showcased the ability to define structured tables with appropriate data types.
- **Data Manipulation**: Demonstrated proficiency in inserting and querying data.
- **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Highlighted the use of CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance readability.
- **Data Analysis**: Illustrated the process of comparing individual salaries to department averages for advanced data analysis.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Querying**:
   - Implement more complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and window functions.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Add constraints and indexes to enhance data integrity and query performance.

3. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy and improve data organization.

4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
   - Create stored procedures and functions to encapsulate complex business logic.

5. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Optimize queries and database schema for better performance.
